# Facial Attribute Prediction

The Face Image Retrieval project challenges students to delve into the exciting domain of computer vision and deep learning to develop a system for retrieving face images from large datasets. In this project, students will explore advanced deep-learning architectures such as the CNN-based model to create a model that can effectively recognize and retrieve face images based on user queries. The project emphasizes the practical applications of face recognition in real-world scenarios, such as surveillance, security, and image retrieval systems.



## Objectives

- Generate facial attributes from images.
- Use deep learning to classify attributes.
- Provide intuitive interface via Streamlit.
  
## Data

CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. The images in this dataset cover large pose variations and background clutter. CelebA has large diversities, large quantities, and rich annotations, including

10,177 number of identities,

202,599 number of face images, and

5 landmark locations, 40 binary attributes annotations per image.

The dataset can be employed as the training and test sets for the following computer vision tasks: face attribute recognition, face recognition, face detection, landmark (or facial part) localization, and face editing & synthesis.
